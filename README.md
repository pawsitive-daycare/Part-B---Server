## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to help with being able to connect the business with potential clients and have them have a seamless and easier way to communicate information. Our main goal for this application is to ensure that all necessary data and information about the service is provided in one place so that clients can access whichever information they need to at ease. The use of the application is through the seamless booking and payment service which will be provided on the website to help clients book the services that the business provides through their own pace and without the need of phone call.

## Functionality/features

- **Register/login**: this allows users to create and login to an account securely to access features
- **Dashboard**: a hub where users can manage thier account, view current bookings and access any saved information. This includes the following features:

  - **Pet profiles**: Users can create detailed profiles of their pet/s and can be updated to their preferences including breed, age, dietary needs, medical history and special instruction that will allow the business to provide the best possible service

  - **Booking system**: allows easy scheduling for users to book a preferred time and dates for services

- **Contact Us section**: provides ways for users to reach the business
- **services Information**: outlines the cost of offered services information of the business to help users with decisions.

  ### Updated features - Dec 12, 2024

  The **Pet Profile** feature has been removed from the original MVP due to time constraints and the complexity of implementation. However, it has been added to our wishlist for future development.
